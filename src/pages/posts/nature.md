title: Welcome to the world of consignment and cool things.
subtitle: >-
  After 35 years in retail I decided that it was time for me to be my own boss. 
  I had considered retirement....that lasted a few months and then I was just
  restless.   I have always been a minimalist and I love to repurpose anything
  that I can.  Opening a consignment shop just felt like something I would
  enjoy.  I came across a cute space that was available in the quaint little
  town of Merrickville, Ontario and I took the plunge!  I have combined my love
  of vintage items, repurposing and retail into something that fun.  I hope to
  share  my daily adventures as I hunt for fantastic finds, repurpose items that
  may otherwise end up in the landfill.  I believe that everything old is new
  again.
